This repository contains the data and code used to conduct the analysis for the manuscript "Using change in a seat belt law to study racially-biased policing in South Carolina".

### How to replicate these analyses

If your intention is to replicate our analysis and you are familiar with GitHub, please clone this repository. All of the analysis is contained within the numerically ordered files contained in the Code directory. 

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, but familiar with R and RStudio, you may wish to download the analysis files by navigating to Code directory and download the numeric files. You can download the raw version of these files and open locally within RStudio. You will also need to download the primary data files found in the Data directory. You can then run the code chunks within RStudio to replicate the analysis. 

### How to reproduce the working paper

To reproduce the working paper, use RStudio to "Knit" the manuscript file 2_Analysis-with-children.Rmd found in the Code folder. Alternatively, you can reproduce these data outputs yourself by following the steps in the "How to replicate these analyses" section.
